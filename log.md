<strong>Description: </strong> init log and todo and a bunch of other shit. I have been working on this fucking game for so fucking long and as soon as I try and bring in assets everything fucking breaks I don't understand the sizing is off I can't get graph shaders to work. EVERYTHING is broken and I have been sitting here for almost 5 hours now trying to fix this shit but I can't. My unity is shit, I'm going to sleep on it and hopefully I don't have as much self pity during cny.
